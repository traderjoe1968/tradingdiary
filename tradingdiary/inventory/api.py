"""Functions to apply securities transactions to inventory and compute realized gains.

Besides the fundamental requirement of keeping accurate tallies, the main purpose
of this module is to match opening and closing transactions in order to calculate
the amount and character of realized gains.

To use this module, create a Portfolio instance and call its book() method, passing in
instances of type capgains.inventory.models.TransactionType.  Alternatively, you can use
any object that implements the mapping protocol, and pass it to the module-level book()
function.

The functions in this module are impure; they mutate the input Portfolio (a collection
of Lots) as a side effect and return Gains. Gains refer to Lots, which are immutable;
changes to a Lot are reflected in a newly-created Lot, leaving the old Lot undisturbed
to preserve referential integrity. A gain.lot refers to the portfolio state at the
moment of the realizing transaction, not the current state.

Gains also refer to transactions, which generally are models.Transaction instances
(wrapping DB rows) are mutable.  You can harm referential integrity by mutating
Transactions after you have bound them to Gains.  Don't to that.  Nothing in this
module mutates a Transaction, once created.

We could plug this hole by converting each models.Transaction to an immutable
inventory.types.DummyTransaction, and converting each FiAccount/Security to an immutable
dummy version, but we'd prefer not to.  It's handy for Lots and Gains to have "live"
references to SQLAlchemy wrappers for Transactions/FiAccounts/Securities during
interactive interpreter sessions.

To compute realized capital gains from a Gain instance:
    * Proceeds = gain.lot.units * gain.price
    * Basis = gain.lot.units * gain.lot.price
    * Holding period start = gain.lot.opentransaction.datetime
    * Holding period end = gain.transaction.datetime
