"""Data structures for tracking units/cost history of financial assets.

Each Lot tracks the current state of a particular bunch of securities - (unit, cost).
Lots are collected in lists called "positions", which are the values of a
Portfolio mapping keyed by a (FI account, security) tuple called a "pocket".

Additionally, each Lot keeps a reference to its opening Transaction, i.e. the
Transaction which started its holding period for tax purposes (to determine whether
the character of realized Gain is long-term or short-term).

Each Lot also keeps a reference to its "creating" Transaction, i.e. the Transaction
which added the Lot to its current pocket.  A Lot's security can be sourced from
Lot.createtransaction.security, and the account where it's custodied can be sourced
from Lot.createtransaction.fiaccount.  In the case of an opening trade, the
opening Transaction and the creating Transaction will be the same.  For transfers,
spin-offs, mergers, etc., these will be different.

Gains link opening Transactions to realizing Transactions - which are usually closing
Transactions, but may also come from return of capital distributions that exceed
cost basis.  Return of capital Transactions generally don't provide per-share
distribution information, so Gains store the realizing price as a separate field to
avoid repeating this calculation.
